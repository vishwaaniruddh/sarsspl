	<h1>About Us</h1>

	<p>
	We are a team of seasoned professionals with cumulative experience of over 50 years in
	Fortune 500 corporates.
	</p>
	<p>
	As parents we felt the need for a digital platform that would test our child’s learning in a
	scientific manner rather than following the traditional ways of preparation in an
	unstructured way.In order to address this need, the idea of Test2Shine was born.
	Headquartered in Mumbai, we continuously engage with educationists, students, parents
	and schools to understand how we can improve our platform to drive efficiency in teaching
	and learning methods.
